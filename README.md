# DeepLearningFinal

Hi! This project encapsulates three unique architectures (LSTM, CNN, and FCN) that attempt
to classify articles as one of ten potential publishers (CNBC, CNN, Economist, Fox News, People, 
The New York Times, Vice News, Politico, Reuters, TMZ). Our best model, the CNN, achieved nearly
50% accuracy!

NOTE: Only heavily filtered versions of the data we used are available in this repo due do
file size restrictions, but we only used the below dataset and all of the scripts used
to create our encoded tensors are present in Scripts and encoder.py
